# This file unmasks unstable Gentoo packages.
#
# Stability of package versions is determined by keywords. Package version is
# considered stable on the given architecture if it contains a corresponding
# keyword. Examples of keywords are: amd64, arm, arm64, riscv.
#
# If the given version is undergoing testing for the given architecture, it
# contains a keyword with `~` prefix. Examples: ~amd64, ~arm, ~arm64, ~riscv.
#
# If there is no keyword for the given architecture, the package version is
# masked.
#
# If you look at a package on packages.gentoo.org, the stable versions are
# marked with green color, unstable versions with yellow color and versions
# without keywords with no color. Example:
# https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-emulation/qemu
#
# By default, emerge installs only stable versions for the requested
# architecture.
# Unmasking of testing versions is done by specifying the package name.
# Unmasking of versions with no keywords is done by specifying the package name
# with double asterisk (`**`).
#
# Unmasks done for specific versions with equality symbol (`=`) are affecting
# only these versions.
# If the mentioned version becomes stabilized, the unmask doesn't really do
# anything - emerge is going to pick the newest stable version available. If
# there is even newer version stabilized, emerge is going to choose it.
# Nothing changes if a newer version becomes available as a testing or masked
# package - the specified version is stil the one which is going to be
# installed.

# QEMU 9.1.2 (the current stable) doesn't build with musl. All newer versions
# build without problems. Unmask the latest testing package.
=app-emulation/qemu-9.2.2

# Use the newest Rust and rustup version. The one considered stable in Gentoo
# is old, we gotta go fast.
=dev-lang/rust-bin-1.85.0-r1
=dev-util/rustup-1.28.1

# llvm-runtimes/libgcc is undergoing testing for amd64 and provides no keywords
# for the rest of architectures. Unmask it with `**`. Our CI proves that it works
# with arm64.
=llvm-runtimes/libgcc-19.1.7-r1 **
# libgcc requires a testing version (19.1.7) of libunwind.
=llvm-runtimes/libunwind-19.1.7
