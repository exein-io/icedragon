# This file unmasks the Gentoo packages which are masked, either by the base
# profile[0] or the musl-llvm one[1].
#
# Masked packages in Gentoo are packages which are explicitly forbidden to
# install, even when the keywords matches (so `package.accept_keywords`
# doesn't help here).
#
# Listing a package in `package.mask` masks a package.
# Listing a package with `-` prefix unmasks it.
#
# We use the latter property to unmask packages, which are masked by Gentoo
# upstream.

# rust-bin ends up being masked on musl-llvm provile. Probably a bug, but for
# now let's unmask ourselves.
